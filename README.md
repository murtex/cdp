Cue-distractor package
======================

General
-------

- the detailed package documentation can be found inside the [`doc` directory](https://github.com/murtex/cdp/tree/master/doc), specifically [here](https://github.com/murtex/cdp/blob/master/doc/cdp.pdf "package documentation") (download as [PDF](https://github.com/murtex/cdp/raw/master/doc/cdp.pdf "package documentation"))
- directories starting with a plus sign (`+`) contain MATLAB sources and are namespaces used to subdivide the package structure (see [Packages Create Namespaces](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_oop/scoping-classes-with-packages.html "MATLAB documentation") for how to use them)
- the package itself needs to be on the MATLAB search path (refer to [`addpath`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/addpath.html "MATLAB documentation") on how to do this)
