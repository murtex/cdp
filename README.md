Cue-distractor package
======================

General
-------

- a detailed package documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/murtex/cdp/blob/master/doc/cdp.pdf "package documentation") (download as [PDF](https://github.com/murtex/cdp/raw/master/doc/cdp.pdf "package documentation"))
- each directory of this package comes up with a (more or less) descriptive README file outlining what is inside (actually you are reading one of those)
- directories starting with a plus sign (+) contain MATLAB sources and are namespaces used to subdivide the package structure (see [Packages Create Namespaces](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_oop/scoping-classes-with-packages.html "MATLAB documentation") for how to use them)
- the package itself needs to be on the MATLAB search path in order to use it (refer to [addpath](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/addpath.html "MATLAB documentation") on how to do this)
