Cue-distractor package
======================

- this package is divided into parts: applications (`apps`), framework (`cdp`) and documentation (`doc`)
- applications are a good starting point to see how to make use of the framework
- the full (and sadly not too often updated) documentation of this package can be found [here](https://github.com/murtex/cdp/blob/maria/doc/cdp.pdf)

Applications
------------

- each application is a collection of scripts (not only Matlab) solving specific tasks of its whole purpose
- so far there are
  - [`klein`](https://github.com/murtex/cdp/tree/maria/apps/klein) as *the* reference application for the entire framework
  - [`eyetrack`](https://github.com/murtex/cdp/tree/maria/apps/eyetrack) as a subset of `klein` having no labeled data available
  - [`cdd'](https://github.com/murtex/cdp/tree/maria/apps/cdd) similar to `eyetrack`
